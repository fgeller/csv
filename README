Go version of cut, with CSV files in mind.

 Differences to GNU cut:
  - Acts as cat when no fields selected

 TODO:
  - CSV mode
    - quoted fields (containing delimiter)
    - escaped delimiter in fields
    - defaults to , as delimiter
  - Argument parsing (long and short options)
  - Error messages for invalid arguments
