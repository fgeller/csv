Go version of cut, with CSV files in mind.

Differences to GNU cut:
  - Acts as cat when no fields selected
  
TODO:
  - CSV mode
    - quoted fields (containing delimiter, double quote escaping double quote)
    - escaped delimiter in fields
    - handling of CRLF (also in quoted fields)
    - select by column header
  - Argument parsing (long and short options)
  - Argument parsing (-- to delimit input files)
  - Error messages for invalid arguments
